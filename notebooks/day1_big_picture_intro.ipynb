        "Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.  \n",
        "The type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable.\n",
        "This value can be changed later, and the variable will adapt to the new type if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example of variable assignment and type change\n",
        "my_variable = 42  # Initially an integer\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Primitive Data Types\n",
        "These are the basic building blocks of data in Python. They include:\n",
        "- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `42`, `-7`\n",
        "- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`\n",
        "- **Strings**: Text data, e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'RTU'`\n",
        "- **Booleans**: True/False values, e.g., `True`, `False`\n",
        "- **None**: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., `None` (other languages may call this `null` or `nil`)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Composite Data Types\n",
        "These are collections of other data types and can hold multiple values:\n",
        "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`\n",
        "- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{\"name\": \"RTU\", \"year\": 2025}`\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, `(\"apple\", \"banana\")`\n",
        "- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, `{\"apple\", \"banana\"}`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Custom Data Types\n",
        "You can also create your own data types using classes, but we will not cover that in this course.\n",
        "We will however use some of the custom data types from libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`, which are built on top of Python's basic types.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, using clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes is crucial for writing readable and maintainable code. Follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) for consistency. Use lowercase with underscores for variable and function names (e.g., `my_variable`, `calculate_total`). Class names should follow CapWords convention (e.g., `DataFrame`, `LinearRegression`). Constants are typically in all caps with underscores (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`). Avoid single-letter names (unless for simple loop counters like `i` or `j`), ambiguous abbreviations, and built-in function names. Choosing meaningful names helps others (and your future self) understand the code's purpose quickly."

        "The **pandas DataFrame** is one of the most important tools for data analysis in Python.  \n",
        "Think of it as a **spreadsheet-like table** where each column can have its own data type (numbers, text, dates, etc.).  \n",
        "It allows you to efficiently store, manipulate, and analyze structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧾 DataFrame Basics — Spreadsheet Analogy\n",
        "- Rows = **records** (e.g., one person, one transaction, one measurement).  \n",
        "- Columns = **fields** (e.g., age, salary, product name).  \n",
        "- Each column can have a specific type: integer, float, string, datetime, categorical.  \n",
        "\n",
        "👉 A DataFrame is like an **Excel sheet**, but programmable and much more powerful.\n",
        "Dataframes can handle much larger datasets than Excel, and they allow for complex operations like filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📥 Reading CSV Files\n",
        "The most common way to load data into a DataFrame is from a CSV file:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "df = pd.read_csv(\"data/iris.csv\")\n",
        "````\n",
        "\n",
        "* `pd.read_csv()` reads comma-separated values.\n",
        "* Other formats: `pd.read_excel()` for Excel, `pd.read_json()` for JSON (mentioned here, details later).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ⚙️ Common Options When Reading CSV\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Delimiter**: Use `sep=\";\"` if the file uses `;` instead of `,`.\n",
        "* **Encoding**: Use `encoding=\"utf-8\"` (default) or `encoding=\"latin-1\"` for special characters.\n",
        "* **Headers**: By default, the first row is treated as headers. You can override with `header=None` or provide `names=[...]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df = pd.read_csv(\"data/custom.csv\", sep=\";\", encoding=\"utf-8\", header=0)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 Identifying Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "Use `.dtypes` or `.info()` to see how pandas interprets your columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df.info()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "* Sometimes numbers are mistakenly read as strings due to formatting.\n",
        "* Use `pd.to_numeric(df[\"col\"], errors=\"coerce\")` to fix issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ❓ First Look at Missing Values\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing values are represented as **NaN (Not a Number)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df.isna().sum()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "* Shows how many missing values are in each column.\n",
        "* Important to detect early for cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 👀 Inspecting Your Data\n",
        "\n",
        "* `df.head()` → first 5 rows\n",
        "* `df.tail()` → last 5 rows\n",
        "* `df.info()` → structure and data types\n",
        "* `df.describe()` → summary statistics for numeric columns\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 These methods help you **understand the dataset at a glance**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Selecting Columns & Filtering Rows\n",
        "\n",
        "* Select a single column: `df[\"species\"]`\n",
        "* Select multiple columns: `df[[\"sepal_length\", \"sepal_width\"]]`\n",
        "* Filter rows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df[df[\"sepal_length\"] > 5.0]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🗂 Other Considerations When Working With CSV\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Large files**: Use `chunksize=` to load in parts.\n",
        "* **Malformed files**: Try options like `error_bad_lines=False` (deprecated, newer versions use `on_bad_lines=\"skip\"`).\n",
        "* **Memory usage**: Check `df.memory_usage(deep=True)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 💾 Saving Data\n",
        "\n",
        "After processing, you can save your DataFrame:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df.to_csv(\"output/cleaned.csv\", index=False)\n",
        "df.to_excel(\"output/cleaned.xlsx\", index=False)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "* `index=False` prevents pandas from writing the row index as an extra column.\n",

        "So now that we know how to load and manipulate data in pandas, let's do a practical exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to determine the least expensive ten foods per 2000 calories from this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "TO do this we will need to:\n",
        "1. Create a new column that calculates the price per calorie for each food item.\n",
        "2. Sort the DataFrame by this new column in ascending order.\n",
        "3. Select the top 10 rows from the sorted DataFrame.\n",
        "4. Display the results.\n",
        "5. Save the results to a Excel file called `least_expensive_food_per_calories.xlsx`.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can freely use AI assistance for this task, including built in Gemini in Google Colab, or ChatGPT, or any other AI tool you prefer.\n",
        "\n",
        "TIP: *If you do use AI assistance, provide clear instructions on what you want to achieve, and ask for code that you can copy and paste into your notebook.\n",
        "You can also ask for explanations of the code, or how to use specific pandas functions.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Also you can use the pandas documentation to find out how to do this.\n",

        "### How to submit your solution\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First you should make a copy of this notebook to your own Google Drive.  \n",
        "   You can do this by clicking on `File` → `Save a copy in Drive`.  \n",
        "   You can optionally rename the notebook to something like `day1_price_analysis.ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Then you can edit the notebook and add your solution to the end of the notebook, or in a new code cell.\n",
        "Feel free to add any comments and explanations to your code as a markdown cell or comments in the code cell(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Download the notebook as a `.ipynb` file by clicking on `File` → `Download` → `Download .ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Upload the `.ipynb` file to the course platform at [RTU DAS](https://www.das.lv/platforma/course/view.php?id=34) in the assignment section for Day 1."
