        "- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `42`, `-7`\n",
        "- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`\n",
        "- **Strings**: Text data, e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'RTU'`\n",
        "- **Booleans**: True/False values, e.g., `True`, `False`\n",
        "- **None**: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., `None` (other languages may call this `null` or `nil`)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Composite Data Types\n",
        "These are collections of other data types and can hold multiple values:\n",
        "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`\n",
        "- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{\"name\": \"RTU\", \"year\": 2025}`\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, `(\"apple\", \"banana\")`\n",
        "- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, `{\"apple\", \"banana\"}`\n",

        "#### Custom Data Types\n",
        "You can also create your own data types using classes, but we will not cover that in this course.\n",
