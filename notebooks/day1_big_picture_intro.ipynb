        "### Dynamic Typing in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "When we create a variable in Python, we are essentially creating a **label** for a value stored in memory.  \n",
        "Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.  \n",
        "The type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable.\n",
        "This value can be changed later, and the variable will adapt to the new type if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example of variable assignment and type change\n",
        "my_variable = 42  # Initially an integer\n",
        "print(type(my_variable))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
        "my_variable = \"Hello, World!\"  # Now a string\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now generally you do not want to change the type of a variable like this too much in real code, as it can lead to confusion and bugs.\n",
        "However, it is useful to know that Python allows this flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Data Types in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has several built-in data types that are commonly used in data analysis and programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Primitive Data Types\n",
        "These are the basic building blocks of data in Python. They include:\n",
        "- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `42`, `-7`\n",
        "- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`\n",
        "- **Strings**: Text data, e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'RTU'`\n",
        "- **Booleans**: True/False values, e.g., `True`, `False`\n",
        "- **None**: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., `None` (other languages may call this `null` or `nil`)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Composite Data Types\n",
        "These are collections of other data types and can hold multiple values:\n",
        "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`\n",
        "- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{\"name\": \"RTU\", \"year\": 2025}`\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, `(\"apple\", \"banana\")`\n",
        "- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, `{\"apple\", \"banana\"}`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Custom Data Types\n",
        "You can also create your own data types using classes, but we will not cover that in this course.\n",
        "We will however use some of the custom data types from libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`, which are built on top of Python's basic types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performing operations on different data types\n",
        "You can perform various operations on these data types, such as arithmetic operations on numbers, string concatenation, and list manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Numeric types support arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
        "\n",
