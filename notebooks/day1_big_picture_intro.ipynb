        "Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.  \n",
        "The type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable.\n",
        "This value can be changed later, and the variable will adapt to the new type if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example of variable assignment and type change\n",
        "my_variable = 42  # Initially an integer\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Primitive Data Types\n",

        "- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `42`, `-7`\n",
        "- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`\n",
        "- **Strings**: Text data, e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'RTU'`\n",
        "- **Booleans**: True/False values, e.g., `True`, `False`\n",
        "- **None**: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., `None` (other languages may call this `null` or `nil`)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Composite Data Types\n",
        "These are collections of other data types and can hold multiple values:\n",
        "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`\n",
        "- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{\"name\": \"RTU\", \"year\": 2025}`\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, `(\"apple\", \"banana\")`\n",
        "- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, `{\"apple\", \"banana\"}`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Custom Data Types\n",
        "You can also create your own data types using classes, but we will not cover that in this course.\n",
        "We will however use some of the custom data types from libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`, which are built on top of Python's basic types.\n",

        "The most common way to load data into a DataFrame is from a CSV file:\n",

        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "df = pd.read_csv(\"data/iris.csv\")\n",
        "````\n",
        "\n",

        "### ⚙️ Common Options When Reading CSV\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Delimiter**: Use `sep=\";\"` if the file uses `;` instead of `,`.\n",
        "* **Encoding**: Use `encoding=\"utf-8\"` (default) or `encoding=\"latin-1\"` for special characters.\n",
        "* **Headers**: By default, the first row is treated as headers. You can override with `header=None` or provide `names=[...]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
