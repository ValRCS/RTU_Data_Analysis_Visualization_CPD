        "- **Why cleaning is critical before analysis**\n",
        "  - Raw data is almost never ready for direct analysis\n",

        "  - Proper cleaning ensures reliability, reproducibility, and trust in analysis outcomes\n",

        "- **Real-world examples of messy data**\n",
        "  - 🧹 Handling missing values - Weather records with missing timestamps or corrupt values\n",
        "  - 🗳️ Survey responses with inconsistent categories (e.g., \"Male\", \"male\", \"M\")\n",
        "  - 🗑 Removing duplicates - Financial transactions with duplicate entries\n",
        "  - 🗑 Log files with noise lines, system messages, or broken encodings\n",
        "  - 📅 Parsing dates - Event logs with inconsistent timestamp formats\n",
        "  - 🔄 Data type conversion - User age recorded as text instead of numbers\n",
