        "  - **Mixed column order** across files (use the header to map columns).\n",
        "  - **Date formats vary** (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD.MM.YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`, `YYYY.MM.DD`) and sometimes **include a time** (e.g., `07:00`).\n",

        "  - **Missing values** sprinkled in as `\"\"`, `NA`, `—`, `-999`.\n",
        "  - **Codes as strings** with possible leading zeros (e.g., `present_weather_code = \"05\"`).\n",

        "\n",

        "- **Enhance code reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be used in different parts of the same program or even in other programs.\n",
