        "### Introduction to Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why cleaning is critical before analysis**\n",
        "  - Raw data is almost never ready for direct analysis\n",
        "  - Errors, inconsistencies, and missing information can distort results\n",
        "  - Proper cleaning ensures reliability, reproducibility, and trust in analysis outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Real-world examples of messy data**\n",
        "  - 🧹 Handling missing values - Weather records with missing timestamps or corrupt values\n",
        "  - 🗳️ Survey responses with inconsistent categories (e.g., \"Male\", \"male\", \"M\")\n",
        "  - 🗑 Removing duplicates - Financial transactions with duplicate entries\n",
        "  - 🗑 Log files with noise lines, system messages, or broken encodings\n",
        "  - 📅 Parsing dates - Event logs with inconsistent timestamp formats\n",
        "  - 🔄 Data type conversion - User age recorded as text instead of numbers\n",

        "- **What it is:** a bundle of **five “messy” text files** (≈50 rows each) simulating daily measurements from Latvian stations in **1925**:\n",

        "- **Deliberate “messiness” to practice cleaning:**\n",
        "  - **Different separators:** `;`, `,`, `|`, and **TAB** (documented in each file’s `# fields=` header).\n",
        "  - **Mixed column order** across files (use the header to map columns).\n",
        "  - **Date formats vary** (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD.MM.YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`, `YYYY.MM.DD`) and sometimes **include a time** (e.g., `07:00`).\n",
        "  - **Numeric quirks:** decimal **commas** (e.g., `0,6`), **units** in strings (e.g., `0.8 mm`), and the Latvian word **“nulle”** for zero.\n",
        "  - **Missing values** sprinkled in as `\"\"`, `NA`, `—`, `-999`.\n",
        "  - **Codes as strings** with possible leading zeros (e.g., `present_weather_code = \"05\"`).\n",
        "  - **Free-text `notes`** in Latvian from the station master (may be blank/missing).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Intended skills to practice (Day 2):**\n",
        "  - Detect & use **separators/column order** from headers.\n",
        "  - **Parse heterogeneous dates** (with optional times).\n",
        "  - Normalize **numerics/units** (decimal commas, `mm`, worded zeros).\n",
        "  - Unify **missing values** and enforce **types** (e.g., cast weather codes to integers).\n",
        "  - Keep useful **categorical text** (`precip_type`, `notes`) intact.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Break down complex problems:** Large problems can be divided into smaller, manageable parts, each handled by a function. This makes code easier to write, understand, and debug.\n",
        "- **Avoid repetition (DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself):** If you need to perform the same set of actions multiple times, you can define a function once and call it whenever needed, rather than writing the same code repeatedly.\n",
        "- **Improve code organization and readability:** Functions group related code together, making the overall structure of your program clearer and easier to follow.\n",
        "- **Enhance code reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be used in different parts of the same program or even in other programs.\n",
        "- **Simplify debugging:** If there's an issue, you can isolate the problem to a specific function, making it easier to find and fix the error.\n",
