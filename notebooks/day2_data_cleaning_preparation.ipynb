        "\n",
        "- **Why cleaning is critical before analysis**\n",
        "  - Raw data is almost never ready for direct analysis\n",
        "  - Errors, inconsistencies, and missing information can distort results\n",
        "  - Proper cleaning ensures reliability, reproducibility, and trust in analysis outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Real-world examples of messy data**\n",
        "  - 🧹 Handling missing values - Weather records with missing timestamps or corrupt values\n",
        "  - 🗳️ Survey responses with inconsistent categories (e.g., \"Male\", \"male\", \"M\")\n",
        "  - 🗑 Removing duplicates - Financial transactions with duplicate entries\n",
        "  - 🗑 Log files with noise lines, system messages, or broken encodings\n",
        "  - 📅 Parsing dates - Event logs with inconsistent timestamp formats\n",
        "  - 🔄 Data type conversion - User age recorded as text instead of numbers\n",

        "  - **Different separators:** `;`, `,`, `|`, and **TAB** (documented in each file’s `# fields=` header).\n",
        "  - **Mixed column order** across files (use the header to map columns).\n",
        "  - **Date formats vary** (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD.MM.YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`, `YYYY.MM.DD`) and sometimes **include a time** (e.g., `07:00`).\n",
        "  - **Numeric quirks:** decimal **commas** (e.g., `0,6`), **units** in strings (e.g., `0.8 mm`), and the Latvian word **“nulle”** for zero.\n",
        "  - **Missing values** sprinkled in as `\"\"`, `NA`, `—`, `-999`.\n",
        "  - **Codes as strings** with possible leading zeros (e.g., `present_weather_code = \"05\"`).\n",
        "  - **Free-text `notes`** in Latvian from the station master (may be blank/missing).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Intended skills to practice (Day 2):**\n",
        "  - Detect & use **separators/column order** from headers.\n",
        "  - **Parse heterogeneous dates** (with optional times).\n",
        "  - Normalize **numerics/units** (decimal commas, `mm`, worded zeros).\n",
        "  - Unify **missing values** and enforce **types** (e.g., cast weather codes to integers).\n",
        "  - Keep useful **categorical text** (`precip_type`, `notes`) intact.\n",

        "In programming, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Think of it like a miniature program within your main program. Functions are designed to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Break down complex problems:** Large problems can be divided into smaller, manageable parts, each handled by a function. This makes code easier to write, understand, and debug.\n",
        "- **Avoid repetition (DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself):** If you need to perform the same set of actions multiple times, you can define a function once and call it whenever needed, rather than writing the same code repeatedly.\n",
        "- **Improve code organization and readability:** Functions group related code together, making the overall structure of your program clearer and easier to follow.\n",
        "- **Enhance code reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be used in different parts of the same program or even in other programs.\n",
        "- **Simplify debugging:** If there's an issue, you can isolate the problem to a specific function, making it easier to find and fix the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, functions are tools for modularity and abstraction in programming, allowing you to create more organized, efficient, and maintainable code.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The code block within the function is indented. Functions can optionally take inputs called *arguments* (placed inside the parentheses) and can return a value using the `return` keyword.\n",
