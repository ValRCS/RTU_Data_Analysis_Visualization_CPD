        "- **Why cleaning is critical before analysis**\n",
        "  - Raw data is almost never ready for direct analysis\n",

        "  - Proper cleaning ensures reliability, reproducibility, and trust in analysis outcomes\n",

        "- **Real-world examples of messy data**\n",
        "  - 🧹 Handling missing values - Weather records with missing timestamps or corrupt values\n",
        "  - 🗳️ Survey responses with inconsistent categories (e.g., \"Male\", \"male\", \"M\")\n",
        "  - 🗑 Removing duplicates - Financial transactions with duplicate entries\n",
        "  - 🗑 Log files with noise lines, system messages, or broken encodings\n",
        "  - 📅 Parsing dates - Event logs with inconsistent timestamp formats\n",
        "  - 🔄 Data type conversion - User age recorded as text instead of numbers\n",

        "  - **Different separators:** `;`, `,`, `|`, and **TAB** (documented in each file’s `# fields=` header).\n",
        "  - **Mixed column order** across files (use the header to map columns).\n",
        "  - **Date formats vary** (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD.MM.YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`, `YYYY.MM.DD`) and sometimes **include a time** (e.g., `07:00`).\n",
        "  - **Numeric quirks:** decimal **commas** (e.g., `0,6`), **units** in strings (e.g., `0.8 mm`), and the Latvian word **“nulle”** for zero.\n",
        "  - **Missing values** sprinkled in as `\"\"`, `NA`, `—`, `-999`.\n",
        "  - **Codes as strings** with possible leading zeros (e.g., `present_weather_code = \"05\"`).\n",
        "  - **Free-text `notes`** in Latvian from the station master (may be blank/missing).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Intended skills to practice (Day 2):**\n",
        "  - Detect & use **separators/column order** from headers.\n",
        "  - **Parse heterogeneous dates** (with optional times).\n",
        "  - Normalize **numerics/units** (decimal commas, `mm`, worded zeros).\n",
        "  - Unify **missing values** and enforce **types** (e.g., cast weather codes to integers).\n",

        "- **Break down complex problems:** Large problems can be divided into smaller, manageable parts, each handled by a function. This makes code easier to write, understand, and debug.\n",
        "- **Avoid repetition (DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself):** If you need to perform the same set of actions multiple times, you can define a function once and call it whenever needed, rather than writing the same code repeatedly.\n",
        "- **Improve code organization and readability:** Functions group related code together, making the overall structure of your program clearer and easier to follow.\n",
        "- **Enhance code reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be used in different parts of the same program or even in other programs.\n",
        "- **Simplify debugging:** If there's an issue, you can isolate the problem to a specific function, making it easier to find and fix the error.\n",

        "### ✅ Success Criteria\n",
        "- Each original text file has a corresponding `.good.txt` output.\n",
        "- Each `.good.txt` loads into a DataFrame without errors.\n",
        "- Basic column consistency achieved (same number of columns and sensible types where possible).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 What to Watch For\n",
        "- Junk header/footer lines (e.g., comments, separators)\n",
        "- Inconsistent separators (`,`, `;`, tabs, or spaces)\n",
        "- Missing fields and short/empty lines\n",
        "- Non-UTF8 characters — use `errors='replace'` if needed\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧭 Suggested Workflow\n",
        "1) **Download & unzip** to `data/` using `download_and_unzip`  \n",
        "2) **List files** and do a quick **line count** with `count_lines`  \n",
        "3) **Clean** with `clean_files(data_dir)`  \n",
        "4) **Load** each cleaned file with `load_cleaned_file`  \n",
        "5) **Sanity-check**: `.head()`, `.info()`, and simple value counts on key columns\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧩 Hints\n",
        "- If a file still fails to parse, adjust `is_good_line` (e.g., skip lines that start with specific tokens).\n",
        "- If different files use different separators, handle at **pandas** stage later (Part 3) by re-parsing columns.\n",
        "- Keep outputs organized: write cleaned files into a `data/cleaned/` subfolder if you choose to extend `clean_files`."
